There is no refactoring.

The provided code snippets for both the original and refactored classes are identical:

Original Code:
```java
package org.animals;

public class Duck extends Bird {

	public void quack() {
		System.out.println("quack");
	}

}
```

Refactored Code:
```java
package org.birds;

public class Duck extends Bird {

	public void quack() {
		System.out.println("quack");
	}

}
```

The only difference is the package name, which has changed from `org.animals` to `org.birds`. This change does not constitute a refactoring according to the provided guidelines. Therefore, no refactorings are detected between the two code snippets.

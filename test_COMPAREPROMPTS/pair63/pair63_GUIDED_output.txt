- **Original Section:** 
  ```java
  public void sleep(){
      int s1 = 1;
      int s2 = 2;
      int s3 = 3;
      int s4 = 4;
      int s5 = 5;
      int s6 = 6;
      int s7 = 7;
      int s8 = 8;
  }
  ```
  
- **Refactored Section:** 
  ```java
  public void sleep(){
      int s1 = 1;
      int s2 = 2;
      sleepNight();
      int s8 = 8;
  }

  private void sleepNight() {
      int s3 = 3;
      int s4 = 4;
      int s5 = 5;
      int s6 = 6;
      int s7 = 7;
  }
  ```
  
- **Refactoring Type:** 
  - Moved Method: The method `sleepNight` was moved from the original `sleep` method to a new private method within the same class.

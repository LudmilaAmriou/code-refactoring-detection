- **Original Section:** 
  ```java
  int s1 = 1;
  int s2 = 2;
  int s3 = 3;
  int s4 = 4;
  int s5 = 5;
  int s6 = 6;
  int s7 = 7;
  int s8 = 8;
  ```

- **Refactored Section:** 
  ```java
  int s1 = 1;
  int s2 = 2;
  sleepNight();
  int s8 = 8;
  ```

- **Refactoring Type:** 
  - **Method Extraction:** The original code had multiple integer variables initialized sequentially. In the refactored code, these variables are moved into a new private method `sleepNight()`, which encapsulates the initialization of these variables.

      int s7 = 7;
  }
  ```

- **Refactoring Type:** 
  - **Method Extraction:** The initialization of the variables `s3`, `s4`, `s5`, `s6`, and `s7` is moved into a new private method `sleepNight()`. This refactoring improves code organization and reusability.

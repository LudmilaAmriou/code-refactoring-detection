### Refactoring 1:
**Original Section:**
```java
public class Dog {
    // Class body
}
```

**Refactored Section:**
```java
package org;
import org.animals.Dog;

public class DogManager {
    private Dog dog;
    public DogManager(Dog aDog) {
        this.dog = aDog;
    }
    
    // Class body
}
```

**Refactoring Type:** Moved Method  
**Description:** The `Dog` class has been moved to the `org.animals` package, and its methods have been moved to the `DogManager` class.

### Refactoring 2:
**Original Section:**
```java
public void barkBark(DogManager manager) {
    System.out.println("ruff");
    System.out.println("ruff");
    takeABreath();
    System.out.println("ruff");
    System.out.println("ruff");
    System.out.println("ruff");
}
```

**Refactored Section:**
```java
public void barkBark(Dog dog) {
    System.out.println("ruff");
    System.out.println("ruff");
    dog.takeABreath();
    System.out.println("ruff");
    System.out.println("ruff");
    System.out.println("ruff");
}
```

**Refactoring Type:** Changed Parameter  
**Description:** The method `barkBark` in the `DogManager` class now takes a `Dog` object as a parameter instead of a `DogManager` object.

### Refactoring 3:
**Original Section:**
```java
public void takeABreath() {
    System.out.println("...");
}
```

**Refactored Section:**
```java
dog.takeABreath();
```

**Refactoring Type:** Removed Method Call  
**Description:** The method call `takeABreath()` has been removed from the `barkBark` method in the `DogManager` class.

### Refactoring 4:
**Original Section:**
```java
public int getAge() {
    return this.age;
}
```

**Refactored Section:**
```java
int age = dog.getAge();
```

**Refactoring Type:** Added Method Call  
**Description:** A new method call `dog.getAge()` has been added to the `doStuff` method in the `DogManager` class.

### Refactoring 5:
**Original Section:**
```java
public int magicNumber = 17;
```

**Refactored Section:**
```java
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < age; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
    sum += i;
}
sum -= dog.magicNumber;
```

**Refactoring Type:** Added Logic  
**Description:** A new logic block has been added to the `doStuff` method in the `DogManager` class, which calculates a sum based on the dog's age and subtracts the `magicNumber`.

### Refactoring 6:
**Original Section:**
```java
private int age = 0;
```

**Refactored Section:**
```java
int age = dog.getAge();
```

**Refactoring Type:** Changed Access Level  
**Description:** The field `age` in the `DogManager` class is now a local variable instead of an instance variable, and its access level has changed from private to public.

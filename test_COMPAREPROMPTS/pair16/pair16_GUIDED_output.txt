There is no refactoring.

The provided code snippets show a class `AnimalMarilho` and its subclass `Reptile`. The `Reptile` class extends `AnimalMarilho` and overrides the `equals` method. However, there are no changes in the structure or logic of the classes compared to the original code. The `Reptile` class does not introduce any new methods, change existing method signatures, modify access levels, add or remove encapsulation, or alter method calls or logic.

Therefore, based on the given guidelines and the provided code snippets, there is no refactoring detected between the two classes.

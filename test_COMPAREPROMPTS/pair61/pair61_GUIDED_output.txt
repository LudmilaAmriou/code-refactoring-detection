There is no refactoring.

The provided code snippets show a class `Feline` and its subclass `Tiger`. The `Tiger` class extends `Feline`, which means it inherits all the fields and methods from `Feline`. However, there are no changes or modifications made to the original `Feline` class in the refactored code. The `Tiger` class only adds a new field `speed` and its corresponding getter and setter methods, but this does not constitute a refactoring of the `Feline` class itself.

If you intended to refactor the `Feline` class, please provide additional changes or modifications that would qualify as a refactoring.

### Refactoring Detected:

1. **Refactoring Type:** Class Inheritance
   - **Original Section:**
     ```java
     public class Feline implements Animal {
     ```
   - **Refactored Section:**
     ```java
     public class Tiger extends Feline implements Animal {
     ```
   - **Description:** The `Feline` class has been refactored into a subclass named `Tiger`. This change indicates that the `Tiger` class now inherits from the `Feline` class, potentially adding specific behaviors or properties unique to tigers.

2. **Refactoring Type:** Removal of Unused Fields
   - **Original Section:**
     ```java
     private int age;
     private int name;
     ```
   - **Refactored Section:**
     (No corresponding section in the refactored code)
   - **Description:** The fields `age` and `name` have been removed from the `Tiger` class. This suggests that these properties are either not relevant to tigers or have been moved to a more appropriate superclass.

3. **Refactoring Type:** Removal of Unused Methods
   - **Original Section:**
     ```java
     public int getAge() {
         return age;
     }
     public void setAge(int age) {
         this.age = age;
     }
     public int getName() {
         return name;
     }
     public void setName(int name) {
         this.name = name;
     }
     ```
   - **Refactored Section:**
     (No corresponding section in the refactored code)
   - **Description:** The getter and setter methods for `age` and `name` have been removed from the `Tiger` class. This indicates that these properties are no longer being managed or accessed through these methods.

4. **Refactoring Type:** Method Overriding
   - **Original Section:**
     ```java
     @Override
     public void action() {
         // TODO Auto-generated method stub
     }
     ```
   - **Refactored Section:**
     (No corresponding section in the refactored code)
   - **Description:** The `action` method, which is overridden from the `Animal` interface, has been removed from the `Tiger` class. This suggests that the specific behavior for tigers related to this method might have been moved elsewhere or is no longer relevant.

5. **Refactoring Type:** Method Signature Change
   - **Original Section:**
     ```java
     public void meow() {
         System.out.println("meow");
     }
     ```
   - **Refactored Section:**
     (No corresponding section in the refactored code)
   - **Description:** The `meow` method has been removed from the `Tiger` class. This indicates that the specific behavior for tigers related to this method might have been moved elsewhere or is no longer relevant.

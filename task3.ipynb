    "# Code Refactoring Detection with LangChain and Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates how to use the LangChain library with the Ollama model to identify and highlight refactored sections of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components:\n",
    "1. **LangChain Core**:\n",
    "   - Used for defining a `ChatPromptTemplate` that structures the comparison prompt.\n",
    "2. **Ollama LLM**:\n",
    "   - A large language model configured with `qwen2.5-coder:3b` and `qwen2.5-coder:latest` to analyze and compare code snippets.\n",
    "3. **Example Input**:\n",
    "   - Two versions of a function `calculate_total_price` (original and refactored) are compared.\n",
    "4. **Expected Output**:\n",
    "   - The refactored sections are highlighted, with both the original and refactored portions formatted as:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - Original Section: {{original_section}}\n",
    "     - Refactored Section: {{refactored_section}}\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Import necessary libraries and initialize the Ollama model.\n",
    "2. **Define Template**: Create a prompt to guide the model in comparing the two snippets.\n",
    "3. **Execution**: Invoke the model chain with sample input code and print the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qwen2.5-Coder Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qwen2.5-Coder** is a cutting-edge series of code-specific large language models, formerly known as CodeQwen. Designed to support developers across various needs, it offers six model sizes—ranging from 0.5B to 32B parameters. For our initial tests, the **3B model (3B parameters)** will be used, as a first test to demonstrate its strong performance in analyzing and comparing code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Enhanced Code Abilities**:\n",
    "  - Significant improvements in code generation, reasoning, and fixing.\n",
    "  - Trained on 5.5 trillion tokens, including source code and synthetic data.\n",
    "  - The 32B version matches GPT-4o in coding capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broader Applications**:\n",
    "  - Supports real-world use cases such as **Code Agents**.\n",
    "  - Excels in mathematical and general reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long-Context Support**:\n",
    "  - Handles up to **128K tokens** using techniques like **YaRN** for extended contexts.\n"

The model's responses were more consistent and confident in identifying the refactorings. However, the more detailed prompt produced less flexibilty (e.g., Added Method Logic, Modified Method Calls). Additionally, the increased detail also led to faster execution times, with results taking over **3 to 5 minutes** per code pair.\n",

It was able to identify a key transformation which is \"Class Encapsulation\". The results were provided longer taking over **4 to 8 minutes** per code pair. Also, the model did not provide aclear explanation of its results, which led us to conclude that while it might successfully detect some refactorings, it might miss some refactorings or create unexistant ones and be less certain about certain changes.\n",

    "We noticed that the model detected the change, but did not consider it a refactoring. The model has been designed to detect refactorings such as changes in method signatures, class inheritance, and logic. However, due to the provided prompt’s guidelines, the model didn't categorize the change in the interface name as a refactoring. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in **Pair 7**, the model detected **Interface Extanding**  between the `Animal` class and `AnimalSuper`, but this was not considered a refactoring because the methods and logic remained unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed prompt guide directs the model to classify only certain types of changes as refactorings. Therefore, despite noticing the structural difference (the change in interface name), the model concluded that it didn’t qualify as a refactoring, as no logic, method signatures, or access levels were altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair 90 is particularly interesting because the model was able to detect that **no change in functionality or logic** occurred — the method still prints the same output. However, the model also correctly identified that the `takeABreath()` method **replaces a direct print statement** in the `bark()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here’s where it gets interesting: while the model recognized this improvement, **the prompt's limitations** may have prevented it from classifying this as a refactoring. Although the change to use the `takeABreath()` method improves code organization, the model did not consider this a refactoring because it didn’t meet the exact criteria outlined by the prompt, such as changes in logic or the structure in a significant way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this example highlights how the model’s understanding of refactoring is **shaped by the provided prompt**. Despite recognizing a good practice in the refactored code, the model could not classify it as a refactoring due to the narrow scope of what constitutes a \"refactoring\" based on the prompt’s instructions.\n",

    "1. **Bonus Prompt**: The **Bonus** Prompt demonstrated the highest accuracy overall, with multiple instances where it was classified as **The Most Correct** or simply **Correct**. This suggests that the Bonus prompt is more reliable in detecting refactorings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unguided Prompt**: The **Unguided** Prompt showed decent performance, frequently achieving **Mostly Correct** results. However, it did not surpass the **Bonus** Prompt in terms of consistent accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Guided Prompt**: The **Guided** Prompt generally lagged behind, with several instances classified as **Incorrect**. While it was not bad at detecting refactorings, it consistently labeled them as non-refactorings, leading to incorrect classifications. Only in two cases (Pair 63, Pair83) did the **Guided** Prompt achieve correctness equal to the other two Prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **General Observations**: \n",
    "   - Refactorings were sometimes missed or misclassified, leading to **Incorrect** evaluations for all Prompts (e.g., Pairs 28, 37, and 61).\n",
    "   - The **Bonus** Prmopt excelled in detecting and accurately classifying refactorings across various scenarios, indicating a stronger alignment with human evaluation criteria.\n",

    "Based on the evaluation across the three criteria (Accuracy, Clarity, and Efficiency), the **Bonus Prompt** stands out as the overall best-performing approach. It achieved the highest accuracy and clarity, although its execution time was slightly longer than the **Guided Prompt**. The **Guided Prompt**, despite being the fastest, performed poorly in terms of accuracy and clarity due to frequently classifying results as \"no refactoring.\"\n",

    "In summary:\n",
    "- The **Bonus Prompt** was the most reliable and balanced approach across all criteria.\n",
    "- The **Guided Prompt**, while efficient, lacked in accuracy and clarity, making it less useful overall.\n",
    "- The **Unguided Prompt** was slower and inconsistent in clarity, making it the least favorable option.\n"

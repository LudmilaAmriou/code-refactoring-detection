There is no refactoring.

The only difference between the original and refactored code is the package name:

- Original Section: `package org.animals;`
- Refactored Section: `package org.birds;`

This change in the package name does not constitute a refactoring according to the provided guidelines. The rest of the code remains identical, including the class definition and method signature.

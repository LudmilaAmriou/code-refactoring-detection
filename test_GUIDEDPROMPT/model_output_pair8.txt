There is no refactoring.

The original code and the refactored code are identical. The only difference is that the interface name has been changed from `Animal` to `AnimalSuper`. This does not constitute a refactoring according to the provided guidelines, as it does not involve any changes to methods, parameters, access levels, or logic within the class.

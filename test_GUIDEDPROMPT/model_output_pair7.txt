There is no refactoring.

The original code and the refactored code are identical. The `Animal` interface remains unchanged with only a minor addition of extending another interface named `AnimalSuper`. This does not constitute a refactoring but rather an extension or modification to the existing interface, which could be considered as an enhancement rather than a refactoring in the traditional sense.

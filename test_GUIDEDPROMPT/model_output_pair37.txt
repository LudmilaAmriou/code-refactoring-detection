There is no refactoring.

The provided code snippets for both the original and refactored classes are identical. There are no changes in method signatures, access levels, or any other elements that would constitute a refactoring. The only difference is the class name from `Turtle` to `TurtleMarinha`, but this does not change the structure or behavior of the class itself.

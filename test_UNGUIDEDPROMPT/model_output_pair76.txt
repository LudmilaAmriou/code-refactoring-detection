- **Original Section:** 
  ```java
  public class Cat extends Feline {
      public void meow() {
          System.out.println("meow");
      }
  }
  ```
  
- **Refactored Section:** 
  ```java
  public class Feline {
      public void meow() {
          System.out.println("meow");
      }
  }
  ```

- **Refactoring Type:** 
  The `Cat` class has been renamed to `Feline`. This is a significant refactoring as it changes the name of the class, which can affect how other parts of the codebase interact with this class.

- **Original Section:** 
  ```java
  public class Chicken {
  ```
  
  - **Refactored Section:**
    ```java
    public class Chicken extends Bird {
    ```
    
    - **Refactoring Type:** The `Chicken` class now extends the `Bird` class, indicating that it is a subclass of `Bird`. This change suggests that `Chicken` inherits properties and methods from `Bird`, potentially adding more functionality or overriding existing ones.

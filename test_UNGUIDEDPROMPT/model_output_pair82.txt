There is no refactoring.

The only difference between the original code and the refactored code is the package declaration:

- Original Section: `package org.animals;`
- Refactored Section: `package org.birds;`

This change in the package name does not constitute a refactoring according to the provided guidelines. A refactoring typically involves changes that improve the structure, readability, or maintainability of the code without changing its external behavior. Simply changing the package name is more of a reorganization than a refactoring.

   - **Original Section:**
     ```java
     public void sleep(){
         int s1 = 1;
         int s2 = 2;
         int s3 = 3;
         int s4 = 4;
         int s5 = 5;
         int s6 = 6;
         int s7 = 7;
         int s8 = 8;
     }
     ```
   - **Refactored Section:**
     ```java
     public void sleep(){
         int s1 = 1;
         int s2 = 2;
         sleepNight();
         int s8 = 8;
     }

     private void sleepNight() {
         int s3 = 3;
         int s4 = 4;
         int s5 = 5;
         int s6 = 6;
         int s7 = 7;
     }
     ```
   - **Description:** The `sleep` method has been refactored by extracting the repetitive code into a new private method named `sleepNight`. This reduces redundancy and improves code readability.

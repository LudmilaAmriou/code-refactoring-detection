### Refactoring Detected:

1. **Class Inheritance and Method Override**:
   - **Original Section**: 
     ```java
     public class AnimalMarilho {
         // Class body
     }
     ```
   - **Refactored Section**: 
     ```java
     public class Reptile extends AnimalMarilho {
         // Class body
     }
     ```
   - **Refactoring Type**: The `AnimalMarilho` class has been refactored into a subclass named `Reptile`. This introduces inheritance, allowing the `Reptile` class to inherit properties and methods from `AnimalMarilho`.

2. **Method Override**:
   - **Original Section**: 
     ```java
     // No method override in the original code
     ```
   - **Refactored Section**: 
     ```java
     @Override
     public int hashCode() {
         final int prime = 31;
         int result = 1;
         result = prime * result + ((action == null) ? 0 : action.hashCode());
         result = prime * result + age;
         result = prime * result + name;
         result = prime * result + spead;
         return result;
     }
     ```
   - **Refactoring Type**: The `hashCode` method has been added to the `Reptile` class. This is an override of a method from the superclass `AnimalMarilho`, likely to provide a custom hash code implementation that considers all relevant fields.

3. **Field Removal**:
   - **Original Section**: 
     ```java
     protected int spead;
     ```
   - **Refactored Section**: 
     ```java
     // Field removed in the refactored code
     ```
   - **Refactoring Type**: The `spead` field has been removed from the `Reptile` class. This indicates that the speed attribute is no longer relevant or necessary for the `Reptile` class, possibly due to a change in requirements or design.

4. **Method Signature Change**:
   - **Original Section**: 
     ```java
     public String getAction() {
         return action;
     }
     ```
   - **Refactored Section**: 
     ```java
     // Method signature remains the same
     ```
   - **Refactoring Type**: No change in method signature. The `getAction` method still returns a `String`.

5. **Method Signature Change**:
   - **Original Section**: 
     ```java
     public void setSpead(int spead) {
         this.spead = spead;
     }
     ```
   - **Refactored Section**: 
     ```java
     // Method signature remains the same
     ```
   - **Refactoring Type**: No change in method signature. The `setSpead` method still takes an `int` parameter and sets it to the instance variable.

### Summary:
- **Inheritance**: Introduced a subclass `Reptile` that extends `AnimalMarilho`.
- **Method Override**: Added and overrode the `hashCode` method.
- **Field Removal**: Removed the `spead` field from the `Reptile` class.

- **Original Section:** 
  ```java
  package org.felines;

  public interface Animal {
      void action();
  }
  ```

- **Refactored Section:** 
  ```java
  package org.felines;

  public interface Animal extends AnimalSuper {
  }
  ```

- **Refactoring Type:** 
  - **Extract Superclass/Interface**: The `Animal` interface now extends an `AnimalSuper` interface. This is a refactoring where the original interface is extended to include methods or properties from another interface, effectively extracting common behavior into a superclass/interface.
